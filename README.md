# mpp
A basic MIPS assembly preprocessor that processes macros. It is meant to be used in conjunction with SPIM, since it does not support macros by itself.

Right now it is functional, but requires refactoring. To compile, just clone the directory, move into it and run 'make'. No dependencies apart from gcc and make itself are used.
